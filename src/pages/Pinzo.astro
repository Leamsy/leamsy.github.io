        <p>
            Pinzo's Smoothie Stand is my own personal project, currently in development.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is a narrative puzzle game, with fruit-rolling gameplay. pinzo has a limited number of movements to get the fruit to the exit before the tide gets too high and swallows him whole. In the meantime, he will be chatting with his troubled customers on the phone, cheering them on.
        </p>
        <p>
            Aside from the 2D and 3D art I am developing everything all by myself, which has lead me to learn things such as how to generate and solve a puzzle level, how to create complex sand shaders or how 2.5D sprite lightning works.

                        I have created a fully fledged puzzle grid editor to facilitate designing and testing levels.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can change the grid size, add and move elements. All in the same place, and with a visual interface.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also developed a puzzle generator using a depth-first search algorithm. The game will feature tailor-made levels, but this tool greatly enhances puzzle designing and testing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You may generate a puzzle from scratch, or try to solve an already existing one. The algorithm will give you the final puzzle and the steps needed to get to the exit.
