        <p>
            Dani & Evan: Dinosaur Books is a visual novel based on the book series "The Adventures of Dani and Evan", more specifically on book number 1.
        </p>
        <p>
            The game aims to encourage young kids to read by including exploration segments, minigames and collectables in the form of the "Explorer's Notebook".
        </p>
        <p>
            I worked as the programmer and designer of the game, but I was also in charge of a lot of other aspects such as animations, sound effects, and texts.

                    <p>
                        I implemented the translation to the <nobr>8 languages</nobr> the game is available in.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Special mention to the Japanese and Russian translations, as they required a completely different set of fonts that proved a challenge to change in runtime.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A custom wrapper of the TMP component allowed the right set of fonts and animations to be displayed for each dialog, providing a rich and fun reading experience.

                        The game's chapter system was built to be reusable and easy to extend.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Everything runs in the same scene and is controlled by ScriptableObjects. Adding a new chapter or section is as easy as adding a new element to the list.

                        The game's story was based on the book, but it needed to be adapted to the gameplay.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I adapted the book's texts to the game, and wrote and designed the exploration segments as natural extensions to the original story.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also wrote the Explorer's Notebook (the unlockables section) and the game's quizzes.

                        They leave a trail of leaves and track up to 10 fingers at the same time.

                        I implemented all the Nintendo SDKs needed to adapt input, saves, resolution, etc. to the Nintendo Switch.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It was important to keep the controls simple, so I updated the input system to change seamlessly between controller and touch input.
